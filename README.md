# Does NFL success reduce Crime in Cities

Abstract: Past research has shown that major sports franchises have no noticeable effect on the circumstances of their fans as much as some would like to claim. However, some believe that the presence of a major sports franchise such as the NFL will have can have an indirect positive effect on variables such as crime by offering the citizens entertainment as a substitute for crime. This paper aims to determine whether or not an NFL team's seasonal success can reduce non-violent crime in its city. Unfortunately, this paper found no such evidence. Using the MSA data from 2000-2005, cities that have an NFL team are predicted to have approximately 876.35 more non-violent crimes per 100,000 people, and cities whose NFL teams make it to the playoffs are predicted to have approximately 279.41 more non-violent crimes per 100,000 people.

The point of this paper was to demonstrate how the of use panel data can remedy for omitted variable bias.
