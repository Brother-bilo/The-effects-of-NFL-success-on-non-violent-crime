# Does NFL success reduce Crime in Cities

Past research has shown that major sports franchises do not positively affect the circumstances of their fans as much as some would like to claim. However, some believe that the presence of a major sports franchise such as the NFL will have a positive effect on variables such as crime by offering the citizens something to do other than commit crimes. This paper aims to determine whether or not an NFL team's seasonal success can reduce non-violent crime in its city. Unfortunately, this paper found no such evidence. Using the MSA data from 2000-2005, cities that have an NFL are predicted to have approximately 1,025.58 more non-violent crimes per 100,000 people, and cities whose NFL teams make it to the playoffs are predicted to have approximately 268.91 more non-violent crimes per 100,000 people.
